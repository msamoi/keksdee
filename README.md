This is a very barebones image board website made for my web technologies course. It was supposed to be done as groupwork, but due to unfortunate circumstances, I had to make almost the entire thing alone.

It takes some inspiration from existing social media websites like Reddit, although it doesn't come close in complexity. As it is right now, most of the functionality is completely raw PHP. It has some flaws, and I want to rework it in the near future to improve the backend functionality, and maybe transition to Golang for the backend entirely.
